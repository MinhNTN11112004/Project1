So the frist week in the project I series of coding is about basic operations, arrays, strings and texts.
This is quite easy for you guys because it just requires you to know the basic stuff about arrays such as: 
+ basic equations in math and implement it into coding.
+ plus, minus, max, min, sum, count, et.cetera on array.
+ convert string number into the interger.
+ replace certain parts of the text and insert the words you want.
