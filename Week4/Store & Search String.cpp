/*Description
A database contains a sequence of key k1, k2, ..., kn which are strings (1<=n<=100000). Perform a sequence of actions of two kinds:
Â· find k: find and return 1 if k exists in the database, and return 0, otherwise
Â· insert k: insert a key k into the database and return 1 if the insertion is successful (k does not exist in the database) and return 0 if the insertion is failed (k exists in the database)
Note that the length of any key is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50.
Input
Two blocks of information. The first block contains a key of (k1,k2,...,kn) in each line. The first block is terminated with a line containing *. The second block is a sequence of actions of two finds described above: each line contains 2 string: cmd and k in which cmd = find or insert and k is the key (parameter of the action). The second block is terminated with a line containing ***. Note that the number of actions can be up to 100000.
Output
Each line contains the result (0 or 1) of the corresponding action.
